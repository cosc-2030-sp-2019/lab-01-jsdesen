# Lab01
For Lab 01:  Process Numbers and Compress Data
John DesEnfants

Some minor help and clarification was recieved for this lab from Eason Mahone, Lane Snively, and Alex Finch.

If the input file contained a 4-byte zero it would create a fully transparent pixel. This is perfectly fine in a BMP image file. You could make the flag a larger file.
